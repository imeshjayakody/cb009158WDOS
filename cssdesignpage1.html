                    <h2>Habitat of the Leopard</h2>
                    <p>This animal chases around night time, ordinarily on the ground or in trees. Panther is by and large asocial
                        creature, living singularly and keeping away from different panthers. Additionally, when panthers
                        inadvertently experience one another, they can take part in a battle. Typically, the creature discharges a
                        grating or sawing hack, to educate different panthers regarding its quality. Home scopes of panthers
                        ordinarily cover with one another. In this way, the home scope of a male panther can frequently cover with
                        regions of numerous females. Being outstanding climbers, these animals burn through a large portion of the
                        daytime hours resting under-protected rocks or in obscure spots among tree limbs. To caution gatecrashers,
                        panthers normally scratch trees, leaving paw marks. Furthermore, due to having a profoundly evolved feeling of
                        smell, they regularly use aroma marks.

                    <!--pharaphased: https://animalia.bio/leopard-->
                    <p>These cats are distributed across huge area, stretching from sub-Saharan Africa to West Asia and the Middle
                        East, reaching South and Southeast Asia and Siberia. Leopards are found in a wide variety of habitats, though
                        they usually give preference to areas, covered with trees. They typically live in woodlands, forests and
                        grassland savannas. Less frequently, they occur in mountainous areas as well as scrublands and deserts.

                    <p>Panthers are carnivores. The eating regimen of these pioneering feeders incorporates a tremendous assortment
                        of creatures like jackals, impalas, gazelles, monkeys, duiker, eland, impala, wildebeest, birds, rodents,
                        hyraxes, rabbits, snakes, sheep, goats, and bugs. Panthers achieve all necessary dampness from their food, so
                        they can get by without drinking water for significant stretches of time.

                    <!--pharaphased: https://animalia.bio/leopard-->
                    <p>Panthers have polygynandrous mating framework, where the two guys and females mate with various mates. They
                        breed over time with a pinnacle period, happening in May, during the blustery season. The growth period goes
                        on for 90-105 days, yielding from 2 to 4 offspring. The infants are brought into the world in a cave. Being
                        incredibly powerless in the wild, the whelps stay covered up, living in a segregated spot, covered with thick
                        vegetation. By the age of 6 - two months, the children accomplish their dim, wooly coat, covered with hazy
                        patches, which serves youthful panthers as disguise, permitting them to chase after their mom. Arriving at the
                        age of 3 months, the infants are weaned, going with their mom at a chase. All in all, they stay with their mom
                        for 13 - 18 months, after which they leave to track down their own territories. They start to breed to 2 - 3
                        years old.

                        The worldwide populace of these creatures is obscure for now, with the exception of explicit populaces in
                        specific spaces of their circulation. Along these lines, populace in Africa is assessed to in excess of
                        700,000 people, while populace in India differs from 12,000 to 14,000 creatures. Nonetheless, the number of
                        inhabitants in the species overall is presently declining.

    <h2><u>Interesting Facts about Leopards</u></h2>
    <ol>

        per PBS Nature.
      </li>
      <li>It is no big surprise that panthers are such extraordinary hunters. They can approach a day and a half (58
        kph), hop forward 20 feet (6 meters) and jump 10 feet (3 m) straight up.
      </li>
      <li>In spite of the fact that named a roaring feline, leopards ordinarily bark when they have a remark.
